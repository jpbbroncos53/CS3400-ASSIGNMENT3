==================

MakesMoreShapes is made obsolete by DestroyByClicking. I kept it in the repository because if you want to know how it works then it is easier than trying to look through DeleteByClicking. DeleteByClicking has stuff added on top of the stucture of MakeMoreShapes so if you are going to use any of the code from either get it from DeleteByClicking
