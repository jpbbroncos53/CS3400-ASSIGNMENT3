CS3400-ASSIGNMENT3
==================

It's seeming like the easiest was of setting up the edit/delete options is to do an event handler similar to what I did in the DeleteByClicking, except have it pop up a new screen with all of the possible edit options for that certain shape. I couldn't figure out an easier way to target them individually


MakesMoreShapes is made obsolete by DestroyByClicking. I kept it in the repository because if you want to know how it works then it is easier than trying to look through DeleteByClicking. DeleteByClicking has code added on top of the stucture of MakeMoreShapes so if you are going to use any of the code from either get it from DeleteByClicking
